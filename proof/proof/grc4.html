<p align="justify">

The MERVEX group develops 4 lines of research:
<ul>
<li> <p align="justify"> <b>1) Fishery resource assesment</b>.
</p>	</li>

<li> <p align="justify"> <b>2) Fishery resource biology</b>.
</p>	</li>

<li> <p align="justify"> <b>3) Living resource ecology</b>.
</p>	</li>

<li> <p align="justify"> <b> 4) Sustainable fisheries and technical measures </b>.
</p>	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
In total, the MERVEX group is made up of 20 members of different categories and specialities, according to which they are distributed in each of the 4 lines of research. 
The organisation chart below shows the composition of each research line, indicating the coordinator and members. 
</p>

<p align="center">

<p align="justify">
In each line the members cover the double facet of advice and research by participating in numerous international groups depending on
ICES (WGBIE, WGWIDE, WGANSA, WGMAS, WGACEGG, WGMME, etc) and STECF (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, depending on the European Commission), 
as well as participating in numerous national and international projects, publishing in scientific and popular journals and 
guiding Master and PhD students in collaboration with national and international Universities.
