<p align="justify">The IEO is structured in 3 research areas (aquaculture, marine environment and fisheries). 
The Fisheries Area is structured in turn into 5 regional programs; MERVEX is integrated into the
Fisheries Resources Assessment Program in the ICES (Atlantic Northwest) area. Assessment is the process 
by which different fishery management alternatives are evaluated. To this end, <b>MERVEX researchers participate in international
 organizations with responsibilities in the assessment of fishery resources, such as ICES <a href="http://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx">(link)</a> 
 or STECF <a href="https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">(link)</a></b>. These institutions are organized into ad-hoc working groups, to evaluate management plans,
 review assessments or respond to requests from the administration (ICES-WKMSY, STECF-SGMOS, IBMegrim, etc.) or stable groups, for annual evaluations of 
 TACs and quotas (WGBIE, WGANSA, WGWIDE, etc) or methodological groups (WGSAM, WGMM, WGMME, etc). MERVEX members participate in these groups and have led
 some of them such as the WGMME or the IBMegrim. In this way, MERVEX's research activity is channeled towards an application to resource management. 
 Therefore, MERVEX has a high international innovative potential.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify"> <b>The members of MERVEX participate in education tasks</b> at Galician universities, mainly through Masters in fisheries orientation 
("Master in Economics, Assessment and Management of the Marine Environment and Fishery Resources" of the "Campus del Mar" or the "Master of Marine 
Biology Galician universities: UVigo-USC-UDC ”) as teachers and coordinators of master's and doctoral theses. <b>In the 2019-2021 period, the members of the MERVEX group
have participated in 4 national projects, leading 2 of them and 2 international projects. 
Likewise, we have attracted a high level of financial resources during this period.
The main journals in which we publish are in the area of fisheries and marine ecology. 
Most of the publications (70 in the last three years) are in the first quartile of these areas</b>.
