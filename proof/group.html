	<li><p align="justify">  <b>Cristina Rodríguez-Cabello:</b> is a senior researcher at the Spanish Institute of oceanography (IEO) responsible for the study of the biology and ecology of deep-sea elasmobranchs. She has participated in various research projects related to the biology of fish, the study of the communities of the bottom of the Cantabrian Sea shelf (ECOMARG, INDEMARES). Currently, she also participates in the projects EVALICES and IMPRESS aimed at analyzing and improving the diagnostic models on the state of exploitation of the different living resources that are of interest to the Spanish fleets operating in the ICES area.

 She has published about 30 articles in evaluated scientific journals. She has presented around 50 contributions at national and international congress and to several international working groups (ICCAT, ICES, OSPAR, EEA). She is a member of the elasmobranch working group (WGEF) at the International Commission for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
